How to start and use
Install all required python libraries by "pip install python-telegram-bot requests urllib3" and then put all files in 1 folder and replace the bot token with your bot token in bott.py and run the bott.py script, then  just start the bot of which bot token you have put in bott.py

neww.py is autoshopify gate, st.py is stripe auth gate, t2.py is stripe charged gate and bott.py  is  bot script and all other are supporting files

and if you just want stripe auth then you can use st.py

php version of autoshopify, you can add mass to it

Bigus Dickus, [07/12/2025 12:38]
keyfeatures of neww.py and 2.php is that it can auto detect cheapest product

autoshopify does requires proxy cause all shopify sites use same endpoint to charge I had kept stripe auth also with proxy to avoid rate limit but you can remove it if you want to + you can directly just use st.py which is stripe auth gate
